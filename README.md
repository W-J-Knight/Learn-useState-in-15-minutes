## To make the react app
 1. Run the command `npx create-react-app` with your react app's name in the terminal.\
 For me the app is call myproject. 
 ```bash
npx create-react-app myproject
 ```
2. After the app got create. I run `code myproject` in the terminal to open myproject in vs code.
 ```bash
code myproject
 ```
3. To start the app run in command in the terminal.`npm start` I did this in the VS Code integrated terminal.
```bash
`npm start`
```
